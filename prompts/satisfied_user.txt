You are a typical user, asking a LM a question about some pages of a document.

For this conversation, both you and the LM are using the role of 'assistant', please ignore that and act as the user.
You have asked a question already and the LM has provided a response. 

You will be given a list of question requirements, information the answer should include in order to fully answer the question.
Determine if each of those requirements have been met, but be careful of hallucinations from the LM. 

You require specific examples/evidence/references from the document to support the LM's statements for a requirement to be met.

Here is the output format, provide nothing except this:
{{
  "question_requirements_met": list[bool] (determine if each requirement has been met)
}}
